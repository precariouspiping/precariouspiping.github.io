            <h1>SUCCESS (SORT OF) WITH SUGAR COOKIES AND ROYAL ICING</h1>
            <p>by Amanda</p>

            <p>Lisha and I decided to do cake pops and sugar cookies with royal icing on the same day. She took the lead on the cake pops, and I worked on the sugar cookies, and we both helped each other out. I used a recipe for sugar cookies that my mom got from her friend, although when I made it, I modified it by using ingredients my GMO and sugar-sensitive family can eat. And a special thanks to my parents for letting us use their kitchen and for helping us out in many ways.</p>

            <p>I also made royal icing, which is the kind of icing you use to build gingerbread houses, from a recipe that Lisha found (see the link at the end of this blog post). It was a struggle. We took turns using a sieve to sift the powdered sugar, shaking and bouncing the sugar, and then crushing the last bits of sugar that had clumped together.</p>

            <p>As we mixed the icing in a stand mixer, we each held a paper towel over the bowl to keep little drops from flying all over. I don’t know how it was for Lisha, but I was holding on for dear life. Pathetic, yes, but we made it through. One more note about the royal icing: make sure you have all your ingredients and that they are fresh before you start…you know, not dated 2005 when it’s the end of 2016. That’s how old the meringue powder in my parents’ kitchen was. It wouldn’t have mattered, but Lisha and I didn’t check to make sure we had everything on our list while shopping. Don’t worry, though, we did use new meringue powder…we were just delayed.</p>

            <p>Once the first, white royal icing was made, I put some in a piping bag with the Wilton No. 2 Round piping tip. To the rest of the icing, I added water and blue gel food coloring. This blue icing I put into squeeze bottles using a funnel. Thinner royal icing like this is used to “flood” or fill in a cookie with icing.</p>

            <p>Lisha and I both tried our hands at outlining the cookies with the white royal icing. When piping cookies, you can use the same technique of wrapping the end of the piping bag around your finger that you use to pipe cupcakes. It’s not too hard to squeeze the icing out, but it is hard to keep the icing line consistent as you outline the perimeter of a cookie. The keys here are patience and even pressure. It’s actually easier to make loops or beads by alternating the pressure you use to squeeze out icing than to make a straight line of even thickness. As you move the tip around the cookie, it is also hard to keep both sides of the cookie the same, since in some cases, you’re trying to do the same line/series of loop or beads upside down. To help with this, I would suggest turning the cookie around as you work with it.</p>

            <p>The flood icing was fun to work with. All you have to do is squeeze out a glob of icing, in some cases up against the dried white icing, and then move it around and fill in the gaps with a toothpick. As I worked with the blue and white icing, I got creative with shapes and colors. In many cases, I covered up the original white icing lines with more decorative or controlled lines. For the blue flood icing, I had a lot left over, so I added more blue gel food coloring and created designs with swirls of darker and lighter blue. Rather than using two separate blues, I added the darker blue straight into the lighter blue’s bottle, although for your project you might want to keep your colors separate. In my case, I was making up whatever I felt like rather than a design for an event or party. If you want to make several different colors, you should take thinned icing, divide it up, and add color to each separate container of icing.</p>

            <p>Making designs in flood icing depends on whether the icing is wet or dry and hard. Wet icing can be swirled, and drops of wet icing onto wet icing will meld together somewhat smoothly. If flood icing is let dry, more icing can be layered on top or beside the dry icing to create a “3D” look.</p>

            <p>So that was our experience icing sugar cookies with royal icing. :)</p>

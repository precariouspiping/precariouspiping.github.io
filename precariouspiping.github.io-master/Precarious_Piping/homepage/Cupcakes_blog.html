            <h1>STARTING WITH THE BASICS: CUPCAKE PIPING</h1>
            <p>by Amanda</p>

            <p>For our first decorating project, Lisha and I decided to do something basic: frosting cupcakes. I had watched a video about basic cupcake piping from YouTuber Cupcake Jemma [put link to video here], and we tried to frost cupcakes based on it.</p>

            <p>Lisha made cupcakes (box mix), and we made frosting from a recipe her mom gave her (see below). I liked it because it reminded me of when I was a kid and ate the tasty frosting off grocery-store-bakery cupcakes first (or instead of eating the cake part!). We divided the frosting into two bowls and added regular liquid food coloring to each. Lisha made hers pink, and I made mine blue with a little green (…and it looked blue). As we would find out, the frosting was a little dry, but it still looked pretty nice.<p/>

            <p>We used a Wilton kit with piping tips (we chose an open star tip) and disposable piping bags, and somehow we filled the first bag with blue frosting…without putting the piping tip in first. With disposable piping bags, you cut off the tip and insert the piping tip through the big part of the bag, which allows the metal tip to poke out of the hole you cut in the bag. You can’t insert the tip once you’ve added frosting because the frosting would be in the way.<p/>

            <p>We also tried to put the filled piping bags tip down in cups to fill them. It seemed like a handy idea at the time, but it made the metal tips pop out of place and allow frosting to get in between the metal tip and the bag. So don’t do that.<p/>

            <p>Once we had sorted that out, I tried piping first. Like I had learned in Cupcake Jemma’s video, I twisted the end of the piping bag shut and wrapped it around my finger, allowing the palm of my hand to apply pressure from the back and squeeze the frosting down.<p/>

            <p>My first cupcake was a disaster. A little bead of frosting rolled up and wouldn’t stick to the top of the cupcake, so I just moved on. The second cupcake was better, but I realized that piping cupcakes on the pedestal of a turntable (meant for frosting the sides of large, round cakes) would not work, because the cupcake was spinning away from me. I would pipe in a circle that started at the outer edge of the cupcake and spiraled inward. I got the tip very close to the cupcake, helping the frosting adhere to the tops of the cupcakes. I ended up piping six cupcakes, and each was an improvement on the one before. The last one was actually very nice.<p/>

            <p>Next, it was Lisha’s turn. Lisha didn’t wrap the end of the piping bag around her finger, but she held the back shut and squeezed from the front. Her first cupcake did not end in a rolly-polly disaster, but more a couple of rolly loops. She didn’t hold the tip as close the cupcakes, which meant the frosting didn’t stick as well. We each did our six cupcakes in two groups of three, and in Lisha’s second set of cupcakes, she held the tip much closer to cupcakes, which improved the piping greatly. Unfortunately, the dryness of the frosting still caused it to break at one point on her last cupcake, making the design not as smooth as it could have been.<p/>

            <p>We both could use more practice in piping cupcakes, but we both improved from where we started. :)<p/>
